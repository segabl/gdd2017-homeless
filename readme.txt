'Homeless' is a game that is played from the perspective of a homeless person, who is trying to get through the day.
The player has to manage living on the street, collecting food and finding shelter from rough weather.
Players are able to interact with the environment, such as searching the trash for food or talking to people
Movement is handled by clicking on a spot in the world where the player wants to go.
A karma system keeps track of the players actions and makes the world respond accordingly.
The game's goal is to let the player shape their own story.
They can try to survive as long as possible, or become criminal, or drink theirselves to death and so on.
