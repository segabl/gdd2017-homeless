# Homeless
*Homeless* is a game that is played from the perspective of a homeless person, who is trying to get through the day. It is inspired by survival games like "Don’t Starve" or "This War of Mine" and has similar features. The player has to manage living on the street, collecting food and finding shelter from rough weather. The game features a fixed camera angle in a 3D environment, with 2D character and object sprites. Players are able to interact with the environment, by clicking on objects and items, much like "Don’t Starve". Movement is also handled by clicking on a spot in the world where the player wants to go. The game includes a simple crafting system to make some basic items, most of the equipment and items will have to be acquired by other means though. Game mechanics also include interaction with NPCs, both benevolent and malevolent. Players will encounter situations that require them to choose between multiple interactions that can affect NPCs positively or negatively while a Karma system keeps track of the players choices. Past decisions might then affect players later in the game.
